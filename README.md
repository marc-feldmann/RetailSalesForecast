# RetailSalesForecast
This project uses gradient boosted trees to predict Rossmann storesâ€™ daily sales six weeks ahead. It uses AWS-hosted data containing daily sales of 1115 stores between 2013 and 2015. Visual EDA is performed in Tableau.

For each Rossmann store, and each day six weeks ahead, 85% mean forecasting accuracy is achieved by the trained model. This is very close to model performance on holdout data:
